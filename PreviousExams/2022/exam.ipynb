    "\n",
    "**Structural balance theory** affirms that social networks tend to be organized so as to avoid conflictual situations, e.g., if a great friend of yours hates someone, you will likely not befriend that person.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory can be operationalized by looking at _triangles_ in an undirected _signed graph_ capturing person-to-person relationships, where a _signed graph_ is a  graph in which each edge is associated with a positive or negative sign, and a _triangle_ is a set of three edges ($\\langle u,v \\rangle$, $\\langle v,w\\rangle$, $\\langle u,w\\rangle$) that fully connect three distinct nodes ($u, v, w$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Triangles_ in an undirected signed graph can be in 4 _configurations_:\n",
    "all positive edges ($\\{+,+,+\\}$); \n",
    "all negative edges ($\\{-,-,-\\}$); \n",
    "two positive edges and one negative edge ($\\{+,+,-\\}$);\n",
    "one positive edge and two negative edges ($\\{+,-,-\\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural balance theory posits that social networks tend to favor triangle configurations with an even number of negative signs (i.e., $\\{+,+,+\\}$ and $\\{+,-,-\\}$), which can be understood as being “balanced” by avoiding conflictual situations. Intuitively, $\\{+,+,+\\}$ could be tagged as “The friend of my friend is my friend”, and $\\{+,-,-\\}$ as “The enemy of my enemy is my friend”, “The friend of my enemy is my enemy”, or “The enemy of my friend is my enemy”. On the contrary, triangle configurations with an odd number of negative signs (i.e., $\\{+,+,-\\}$ and $\\{-,-,-\\}$) are unstable (“unbalanced”) according to structural balance theory and will thus occur less frequently in social networks. For instance, me being friends with two mutual enemies ($\\{+,+,-\\}$) would lead to tension that could be resolved if the two enemies became friends or if I took sides and ended my friendship with one of the two. Similarly, two among three mutual enemies ($\\{-,-,-\\}$) would have the incentive to form an alliance to “gang up” against the third.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some social scientists have argued that three mutual enemies ($\\{-,-,-\\}$) is not necessarily a triangle configuration that social networks tend to avoid. This gives rise to **weak structural balance theory**, which only posits that social networks tend to avoid the “unbalanced” triangle configuration $\\{+,+,-\\}$.\n",
